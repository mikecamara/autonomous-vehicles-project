* (ii) Github [code](https://github.com/mikecamara/autonomous-vehicles-project)
* (iii) Trained [models](/models), that can later be run.

The files above are related to my participation in small-scale autonomous vehicles competition in DeltaX. In the competition, 1:10 scale vehicles equipped with vision sensing, compete in autonomous driving. Main prize 1000 euros.

The DonkeyCar platform used in DeltaX Self-Driving competition and for other student projects.

The students can take up a research project in different areas of autonomous driving, such as behaviour modeling and prediction, road-user interaction, mapping etc. The same DonkeyCar 1:10 scale platfrom is avaibable for projects also beyond the competition, e.g. for developing and testing traffic sign or traffic light detection. Alternatively, one can work in simulation or on a static dataset without actually trying anything in the real world.
